\section{The Spaceship}

The crew of a derelict spaceship is asleep in the cryo-chambers.
In the meantime, the MUL-T robot unit is preparing the uniforms and tools prior to landing, but a complete description of whom uses which tool is not provided. Instead, there are pieces of information scattered through the ship. The information reads:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The Commando has a shotgun.
    \item The Engineer wears purple while the Loader prefers yellow.
    \item The Mercenary has a blue suit.
    \item Someone uses a white robe and a Kyaro's ring.
    \item The Huntress wears red and has a bow.
    \item The crew member with orange clothing holds a shotgun.
    \item Two tactical turrets are the tools of the crew member who wears purple.
    \item The katana belongs to the crew member in blue.
    \item The Artificer uses a Kyaro's ring.
    \item The crew member with a yellow vest uses a reinforced armor.
\end{itemize}

Write a program in prolog to generate a full description of the uniforms and tools of all six crew members.
